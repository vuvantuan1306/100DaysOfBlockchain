# Day 5: Verifying & Interacting with Smart Contract on Sepolia

Today, I completed the following tasks as part of the #100DaysOfBlockchain challenge:

---

## âœ… Contract Verification on Etherscan

I verified the HelloWorld smart contract deployed to Sepolia using Hardhat Verify.

- Contract address: `0xf7B5F5Ae458c7293Ad8aafB98884c70C0b28f476`
- Etherscan: [View on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xf7B5F5Ae458c7293Ad8aafB98884c70C0b28f476#code)
- Constructor argument: `"Hello, Web3!"`

## ðŸ”„ Interacting with the Contract

I wrote an `interact.js` script that:

- Reads the current message from the smart contract
- Sends a transaction to update the message
- Reads the updated message from the blockchain

### Output:

ðŸ“¥ Current message: Hello from Day 5!
âœ… Updated message: Hello from Day 5!

This confirmed that both `message()` and `setMessage()` functions are working correctly on the testnet.

## ðŸ’¡ What I learned:

- How to verify a contract with constructor arguments
- How to interact with deployed contracts using scripts
- How to send and wait for a transaction using Hardhat
