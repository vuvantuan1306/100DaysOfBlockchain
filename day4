# Day 4 - Deploying HelloWorld Contract to Sepolia Testnet

Today I deployed the `HelloWorld` smart contract to the Sepolia testnet using Hardhat and Infura.

## âœ… What I did:
- Installed `dotenv` to manage sensitive keys securely
- Created a `.env` file to store `PRIVATE_KEY` and `INFURA_API_KEY`
- Updated `hardhat.config.js` to support Sepolia network and Solidity version `^0.8.28`
- Wrote a `deploy.js` script inside the `scripts/` directory
- Successfully deployed the contract and received the testnet address

## ðŸš€ Contract Address (Sepolia):
```
0xf7B5F5Ae458c7293Ad8aafB98884c70C0b28f476
```

## ðŸ’¡ Learned:
- How to configure Hardhat for deploying to a public testnet
- Importance of `.env` for protecting secrets
- Fixing compiler mismatch issues (`HH606`)
- Sepolia is a great sandbox for Ethereum development!

Tomorrow I'll start working on verifying the contract on Etherscan and interacting with it via frontend or scripts. Stay tuned!
